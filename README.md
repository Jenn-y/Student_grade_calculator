# Student_grade_calculator
A console app that allows you to enter exam scores and percentage of 
final grade they carry and computes overall numeric score for the course
and final letter grade. Student has options to reset scores and percentages, 
as well as option to print entire grade summary. I did it to help me understand
my grading system :smile:
<br/>... and to practise object - oriented programming in Java.
